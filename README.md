Information about the Kan-Ban Method
## Definition of Kan-Ban
Kan-Ban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It visualizes both the process and the actual work passing through it. The goal of this process is to idenitfy processes that have limited capacity and reduce the capacity of the whole chain. We want ot be able to fix these procesess so work can flow through cost-effectively at an optimal speed. 

## Where Kan-Ban Originated
The first Kan-Ban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota automotive in Japan. The purchase was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally. A key reason for developing Kan-Ban was because of the inefficient and unproductive manner of Toyota compared to its rivals. After implementing Kan-Ban Toyota achieved a flexible and efficient just-in-time production control system that increased productivity while reducing cost-intensive inventory of raw materials, semi-finiahsed materials, and finished products.

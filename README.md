Information about the Kan-Ban Method
## Definition of Kan-Ban
Kan-Ban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It visualizes both the process and the actual work passing through it. The goal of this process is to idenitfy processes that have limited capacity and reduce the capacity of the whole chain. We want ot be able to fix these procesess so work can flow through cost-effectively at an optimal speed. 

## Where Kan-Ban Originated
The first Kan-Ban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota automotive in Japan. The purchase was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally. A key reason for developing Kan-Ban was because of the inefficient and unproductive manner of Toyota compared to its rivals. After implementing Kan-Ban Toyota achieved a flexible and efficient just-in-time production control system that increased productivity while reducing cost-intensive inventory of raw materials, semi-finiahsed materials, and finished products. The Kan-Ban system controls the entire value chain from the supplier to to the end consumer. 

## What is the Kan-Ban Method
This process is used to generally improve whatever you do, this could be software development, IT/ Ops, Staffing, Recruitment, Marketing and Sales, Procurement etc. It requires that a system is already in place so that Kan-Ban can be applied to incrementally change the underlying process.

## Kan-Ban's Principles and Practices
Following these princples and practices will allow you to maximize the use of the Kan-Ban method. 

Principles:
1. Start with what you are doing now
- This method does not want you to make any changes to your exisitn setup/process right away. Any changes can occur over time at a pace the team is comfortable with. 

2. Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
- Kan-Ban wants you to make small changes instead of making big radical ones that could potentially resisitance between the team and the organization.

3. Initially, respect current roles, responsibilities and job titles
- Kan-Ban does not impose any organizational changes by itself. The team as a whole will collaborate and identify anything that needs to be changed.

4. Encourage acts of leadership at all levels
- People at all levels can provide ideas and show leadership to implement changes to continually improve the way they deliver their products and services. 

## 6 Core Practices of the Kan-Ban Method
Practices:
1. Visualize the flow of work
- You need to do this either on a physical board or an electronic Kan-Ban board. Depending on your process you board can be very simple or very elaborate. Once you visualize ypour process then you can visualize the current work that you and your team are doing. This can be done by using stickies or cards with different colors to signify either different classes of service or different work items. 

2. Limit WIP (Work in Process)
- Limiting WIP encourages your team to complete work at hand first before taking up new work. This allows new work to be pulled in by the team. Many teams usually start with a WIP limit of 1 to 1.5 times the number of people working in a specific stage. Limitimg WIP and putting the WIP limits on each column of the board not only helps the team members first finsih what they are doing before taking up new stuff - nut also communicates to the customer and other stakeholders that there is a limmited capacity to do work for any team. 

3. Manage Flow
- The Kan-Ban system helps you manage flow by highlighting the various stages of the workflow and the status of work in each stage. This system helps your team analyze the system and make adjustments to improve flow so as to reduce the tiume it takes to complete each piece of work. You must see how long work stayes in these "handoff stages." Reducing the time spent in these wait stages is key to reducing cycle time. This allows you to improve your ability to forecast completion times.
4. Make Process Policies Explicit
5. Implement Feedback Loops
6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (Using the scientific method)
